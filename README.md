## EdiText
This is a plain text editor with tabs I made for my school project. I don't know what I was thinking back when I thought of making this, but the party option is pretty fun.
To execute it without errors (hopefully):
- Clone the repository.
- Run `Main.java`, preferably through the terminal.
